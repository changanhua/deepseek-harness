## Summary

The package carries browser-to-Host Remote calls, exact Fetch responses, and connection generations. The Client plugin mounts `ctx.connection` with current-page loopback state, a generic RPC carrier, the active generation and its Host facts, and the registration point for one generation source. A generation becomes visible when its source reports ready; source completion, failure, withdrawal, or an explicit stop clears it before `ConnectionController` reconnects with backoff.

## Use this package

The browser uses HTTP POST for Remote unary calls. API Gateway owns the `/api/remote.mux` WebSocket and its logical streams; in-process compositions provide equivalent Remote streams through `connection.rpc.open` without opening a WebSocket. The Host half owns the sole `/api` route, Fetch bridge, browser authentication, Host/Origin checks, and exact `GET`/`HEAD` route registry. Typert Gateway claims generated Remote endpoints, feature packages register non-JSON responses such as Session-log downloads, and unclaimed requests return 404. Loopback hostname classification remains package-internal to the browser-facing Client state.

## Browser authentication and request trust

The shipped `dsh-web-app` Profile disables browser authentication, so loopback index, Host RPC, and WebSocket requests use the clean root URL without a launch token or cookie. Set Connection `browserAuth` to `true` in a profile patch when a process token and signed browser session are required. Static assets remain public in either mode, and the HTTP carrier accepts no Authorization-header token.

When `browserAuth` is enabled, each process mints a random launch token. `dsh-web-app` prints and opens the root URL with `?token=...`; `frontend-static` delegates root and index requests to `ctx.connection.authorizeIndex`, which accepts that token only on `GET /`, writes an authority-bound signed cookie, and redirects to clean `/`. The cookie signing secret is the owner-scoped `client-connection/browser-session` grant record in `ctx.credentials`, and `cookieMaxAgeDays` defaults to 30 days.

Every request passes `src/api-request-trust.ts`. Its `Host` must be loopback or match a `trustedHosts` entry: exact on `host:port`, any port on port-less entries, both sides WHATWG-normalized. An attached `Origin` must equal that Host and `sec-fetch-site: cross-site` is refused. Malformed configured authorities fail plugin load. These checks defend DNS rebinding and cross-site browser requests; they never establish identity. A failed Host/Origin check returns 403, while enabled browser authentication returns 401 for a trusted unauthenticated request. `dsh web --host 0.0.0.0` remains unsupported.

## Connection generation

API Gateway Client registers the internal `$events` logical stream as the sole generation source, independently of whether any `$on` listener exists. The Host attaches all incremental listeners in the API Remotes source factory, then sends one `{ type: 'ready', clientId, host: { home } }` item before events. `ConnectionController` publishes that generation and calls `onConnected` only after the ready item arrives, so baseline acquisition cannot race ahead of incremental observation.

An ended `$events` stream, a Remote stream error, a non-ready opening item, or a malformed event item invalidates the current generation. The controller immediately withdraws the generation, publishes `reconnecting`, and reopens `$events` after backoff. Gateway mux reconnects the physical WebSocket; Connection generation reopens the logical stream and establishes the next baseline starting point.

## Model Experience

None, as the wire consumer layer moves already-composed messages between browser and host; nothing here reaches a model request.

#### KV Cache effect

None; this package neither assembles nor sends a provider request.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>

- **The `/api` bridge buffers each request body in memory** — `maxRequestBodyBytes` (default 300 MiB, sized for the default 200 MiB aggregate image limit after base64 expansion plus envelope headroom) is therefore also the per-request resident bound; a streaming body path would be needed to lower it without shrinking the image limits.
- **The browser cookie is not marked `Secure`** — loopback HTTP is the shipped transport, so exposing the same authority over plaintext networking can expose the bearer cookie in transit.
- **There is no logout operation** — clearing the browser cookie ends one browser session; deleting the owner credential record and restarting `dsh` revokes every session.
